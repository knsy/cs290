		<h4>What is imgur?</h4>
				<p>imgur is an image hosting site that has an API(Application Programming Interface)<br>
				 that allows us to interact with imgur from the comfort of our own website.</p>
<br>
		<h4>Why do I care?</h4>
				<p>Let's say you are writing a sweet-ass homepage for yourself and you love cats.<br>
				Well, by the end of this guide you'll be able to put a link to a random new image of cats<br>
				from imgur's database that will change every time you refresh the page.<br>
				I wish I loved cats this much.</p>		
<br>
		<h4>Cats? Really?</h4>
				<p>Cats are an example. Imgur's API is quite extensive and this guide is meant to get<br>
				 you up and running with something super simple that you can build on later as you explore further.</p>	

<br>
		<h4>Why are we doing this? Isn't there official documentation...</h4>
				<p>There is, and it can be found at <a href="https://api.imgur.com/">https://api.imgur.com/</a>
				 but it is aimed at somebody who has some <br>
				 experience with API's already. We are aiming at people who have some experience with <br>
				 web programming and just need a to get something up and running to get them on their way.</p>
